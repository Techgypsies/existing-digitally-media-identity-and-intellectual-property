        <ul>
          <li>Do you share your creative work on the web?</li>
          <li>Do you use the web and social media service to tell the world who you are or want to become professionally?</li>
          <li>Do you have control over your data and your digital identity?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Join journalist and author Audrey Watters and blogger and API evangelist Kin Lane for an intimate discussion of what it means for creatives to carve out digital identities and take control of their own data in the age of ubiquitous proprietary tools and platforms controlled by giant social media companies.</p>
